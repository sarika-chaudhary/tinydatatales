The main tools used are [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). Since this website is used to explore and learn these tools, there is a possibility of mistakes. You are most welcome to point these out.
