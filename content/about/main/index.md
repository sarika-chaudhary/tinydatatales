  I am currently pursuing my PhD in Economics from [CSRD, JNU](https://www.jnu.ac.in/sss/csrd). I have completed my MPhil in Economics from the same centre and my MPhil Dissertation was on the question of wage discrimination in the urban labour market in India. 

  Previously, I did Masters in Development and Labour Studies at [CISLS,JNU](https://www.jnu.ac.in/sss/cisls). During my masters, I was involved in two research projects, ‘Employment, Working and Livelihood Conditions of the Migrant Workers from Bihar in the Informal Sector in NCR’, and another on the oral histories of the Warli Adivasi Movement, which has been recently published as a monograph, Red Flag of the Warlis published by LeftWord. I was also involved in documenting the history of the trade union movement in the banking sector which has been published as a monograph, [Struggling for Nation Building: A Brief History of All India Bank Officers’ Confederation](https://www.aakarbooks.com/author-list.php?autid=541) published by Aakar Books. 

  Currently, my research interests concern the question of wages and social inequality in the context of contemporary India. I have also been involved in the student movement at JNU and had served as the Vice-President of the JNU Students’ Union in 2018-19. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sarika_jnu) and [GitHub](https://github.com/sarika-chaudhary). 


  I live in New Delhi, India.
