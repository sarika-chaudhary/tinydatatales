The National Testing Agency (NTA) is expected to release the results of UGC-NET exam for December 2021 and June 2022 merged cycles in the first week of November 2022. The application process for the same examination began in May 2022. It is was initially announced that the examination would be held in phased in July and August. However, it was later postponed and finally exam happed in four phases. Phase 1 of the examination was held from July 9 to July 12; phase 2 from September 20 to September 23; phase 3 from September 29 to October 1; phase 4 from October 8 to October 14. Thus, it took NTA more than five months to conduct one examination. If such delay in examination be continued the merged examination would become a norm rather than exceptions. Therefore, in this article I have tried to analyse the impact of such merged examination using the data from last few examinations conducted by the NTA.

The UGC-NET exam, which is generally conducted by the National Testing Agency biannually, had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the merging of the two pending cycles of the exam gave a glimpse of hope to candidates, as qualifying the exam, is a requisite for qualifying for the post of Assistant Professor, the Junior Research Fellowship (JRF), and even for research courses at various universities.  However, while it would be expected that such a merger would also lead to proportional increase in seats, the same has not been seen through the data released by the UGC. Thus, by reducing the number of qualifying candidates, the UGC has actually reduced the number of fellowships it awards from the mandated policy, without any prior intimation to candidates.  
 
The UGC through a notification had declared that from December 2017, in the UGC-NET exam, 6 percent of the total candidates who appeared in both the papers of the examination would be declared qualified for the post of assistant professor with the reservation policy being applied to select the top 6% in each category. In 2019, as had been the practice, two exams were conducted, one in June and another in December. However, in 2020, only the June Cycle of 2020 was conducted in December 2020 after being postponed due to the pandemic. The December cycle of 2020 and June cycle of 2021 were conducted in December 2021 for which the result was declared in February 2022.
 
Two things can be observed from the table below based on the data of candidates who applied for the exam. Firstly, the number of candidates appearing for the UGC-NET exam has declined sharply due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This decline is so sharp that despite two exam cycles happening together the numbers are far lower than the pre-COVID numbers.
